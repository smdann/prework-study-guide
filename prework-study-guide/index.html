        <h2>Git</h2>
        <p>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project. We access Git via the command line.</p>
        <p>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with other, you need to use another tool called GitHub.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Git commands always start with git</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on, shows modified files in working directory (staged for your next commit)</li>
          <li>git checkout -b feature/branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds modifications in the current working brach to the staging area (-A flag indicates that we want to add all changes)</li>
          <li>git commmit -m "descriptive message": commits your staged content as a new commit snapshot</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: checks if our local branch is in sync with the base branch in GitHub and pulls down any changes</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/branch-name: pushes the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch</li>
