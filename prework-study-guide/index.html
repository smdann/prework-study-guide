        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <h3>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</h3>
       <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>It's made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages.</li>
       </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>HTML Elements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets (<>).</li>
          <li>Commonly used elements include: text elements, image elements, header elements, and list elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <h3>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</h3>
       <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
       </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>CSS Box Model</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>CSS box model: each box consists of margins outside the element, the elements borders, borders, padding, and content.</li>
         <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box.</li>
         <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
         <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
       </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>CSS Rules</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>CSS rule format: selector{property: value; property: value}
         <li>{property: value} = declaration</li>
         <li>{property: value; property: value} = declaration block</li>
         <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
         <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
       </ul>
       <br>
       <h3>Additional Info</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>The "*" selector applies a rule to all elements visible on the page.</li>
         <li>Two selectors can be combined into a single CSS rule by separating them with a comma, which allows the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
         <li>Grouping elements that share the same style together helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
         <li>When we create an external CSS file, we must link it to the HTML file.</li>
       </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
      
       <ul>
         <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project. We access Git via the command line.</li>
         <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, you need to use another tool called GitHub.</li>
         <li>Git commands always start with git</li>
         <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on, shows modified files in working directory (staged for your next commit)</li>
         <li>git checkout -b feature/branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
         <li>git add -A: adds modifications in the current working brach to the staging area (-A flag indicates that we want to add all changes)</li>
         <li>git commmit -m "descriptive message": commits your staged content as a new commit snapshot</li>
         <li>git pull origin main: checks if our local branch is in sync with the base branch in GitHub and pulls down any changes</li>
         <li>git push origin feature/branch-name: pushes the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch</li>
